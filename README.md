# restaurantApp
This is a single page application.


This web app followed an online course. 


It uses AngularJS framework to build up the client side app. 
RESTful Services were provided by json-server.

The client-server communication was handled by Angular $resource.

Unit and integration tests were performed using Jasmine and Karma.

End-to-end tests were performed using Protractor.

Gulp was used to build the project and serve the built project (the dist directory contains the distribution which can be deployed).
